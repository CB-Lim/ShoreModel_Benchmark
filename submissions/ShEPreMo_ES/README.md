## Shoreline Evolution Prediction Model (ShEPreMo)
### Model description

ShEPreMo [1,2], a modified version of ShoreFor [3,4], integrates longhore sediment transport and shoreline migration due to water level fluctuations in addition to cross-shore sediment transport. This is achieved by substituting the linear $b$ term in ShoreFor with these processes. The rate of shoreline position change, $dx/dt$, is given by

$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = a(F^++rF^-) + \frac{b}{h_c}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y} + \frac{c}{tan \beta}\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} + d $$

where $x$ represents the shoreline position, and $t$ is the time. The terms on the right hand side of the equation represent the cross-shore sediment transport, longshore sediment transport, shoreline migration due to water level fluctuations, and unresolved processes, respectively. a, b, c, and d are the site specific coefficients that need to be calibrated.

### Model implementation
ShEPreMo was applied to ***Task1.Short-term prediction***, ***Task2.Medium-term prediction***, and ***Task3.Long-term prediction***. For all transects, the model coefficients were calibrated independently using breaking wave characteristics ($H_{sb}$, $T_p$, $\theta_{b}$) and historical shoreline data from 1999 to 2018 which is smoothed using gaussian smoothing. The calibrated model was then used to predict short-term (from 2019-01-01 to 2023-12-31), medium term (from 1951-05-01 to 1998-12-31), and longterm (2019-01-01 to 2100-12-31) shoreline positions with daily timestep.

### Model classification
#### Model mechanics
- [ ] Physics-Based Models (PBM): couple hydrodynamics, waves, and morphodynamics through mass and momentum conservation laws.
- [x] Hybrid Models (HM): use observational data to calibrate free parameters in the equilibrium configuration of a system.
- [ ] Data-Driven Models (DDM): use observational data to train regression models (e.g. machine learning, statistical downscaling).
#### Model elements 
- [x] Cross-shore: model the shoreline position for each transect independently.
- [x] Long-shore: incorporate the interaction of shoreline position across different transects.
- [x] Sea level: consider the impact of sea level rise on shoreline position.
- [x] Linear trend: consider the impact a residual linear trend on shoreline position.
