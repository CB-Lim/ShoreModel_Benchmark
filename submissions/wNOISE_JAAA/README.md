## WHITE NOISE model
### Model description
The predictions provided here were obtained by scaling white noise (35 days rolling mean gaussian noise) based on the mean and standard deviation of the satellite observations in the calibration period.

### Model classification
#### Model mechanics
- [ ] Process-Based Models (PBM): couple hydrodynamics, waves, and morphodynamics through mass and momentum conservation laws.
- [ ] Hybrid Models (HM): use observational data to calibrate free parameters in the equilibrium configuration of a system.
- [x] Data-Driven Models (DDM): use observational data to train regression models (e.g. machine learning, statistical downscaling).
#### Model elements (multiple choices)
- [x] Cross-shore: model the shoreline position for each transect independently.
- [x] Long-shore: incorporate the interaction of shoreline position across different transects.
- [ ] Sea level: consider the impact of sea level rise on shoreline position.
