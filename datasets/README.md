## Input datasets

This folder contains all the input datasets for shoreline models. Each folder contains a README.md file that further describes the dataset

### Beach profile
The collection of beach profiles from stereo photogrammetry and Lidar survey. The coordinates projection is GDA94/MGA Zone 56.
Columns:
- **Block**: Block of survey.
- **Profile**: Profile ID of survey.
- **Year/Date**: Date of survey
- **Chainage**:	The distance along a line from an arbitrary starting point [m]
- **Elevation**:Height above the Australian Height Datum [m]
- **Easting**:Eastings of survey point [m]
- **Northing**:Northinings of survey point [m]
- **Survey Type**:Type of survey



### Coordinates
The coordinates for the landward and seaward ends of transects are provided in `transects_coords.csv`.
These coordinates are in a local coordinate system, deliberately shifted (not distorted or rotated), and are expressed in easting and northing with a unit of meters. \
They do not reveal the actual geographical location of Beach_X.
Columns:
- **ID**: ID of each transect
- **Land_x**: Eastings of landward end of transects
- **Land_y**: Northings of landward end of transects
- **Sea_x**: Eastings of seaward end of transects
- **Sea_y**: Northings of seaward end of transects
